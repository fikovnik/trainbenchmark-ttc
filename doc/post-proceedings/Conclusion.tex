\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

This paper presents a solution for the Train Benchmark case study of the 2015 Transformation Tool Contest.
It demonstrates some of the features of the \SIGMA internal DSLs for model manipulation as well as the extensibility, expressiveness and scalability of the Scala host language.
The solution is realized as a tiny internal DSL in Scala that mixes in \SIGMA common infrastructure for EMF model querying and manipulation.
There is a significant improvement in the readability and conciseness of the solution, yet the performance is similar to the reference Java version.

% This case study provides a good illustration for some of the capabilities of an internal DSL approach to model querying and transformation.

% Say something about Scala itself
